## Intro
[**Sass Partials**](https://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-4) allow you to split up your styles into multiple files and even keep them more organized with sub-folders.

This allows you to keep different parts of the website seperated in different files and makes it easier to locate styles when you are debugging your website.
